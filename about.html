			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>How it works? 🔍</h3>
					<p>Through the Spotify API, we collect all the information from your account, taking into account listened songs, playlists, likes, and artists you follow, among others. With that, we can generate a list of your most listened-to artists, as well as genres or songs within a predetermined time period. If you’re technically savvy, you can check the source code on <a href="#">GitHub</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Is my Spotify data compromised? 🐱‍👤</h3>
					<p>Absolutely not! Login data, such as your password, is processed by Spotify, so it is protected by their own security methods. You don’t need to worry about logging into this website; you’re safe!✨</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Can I contribute to the project? 📦</h3>
					<p>There are several ways to contribute. This project is open source, so if you’re a programmer, you can always contribute through a <a href="#">pull request</a>. There are no strict rules: create a new theme or enhance existing functionality! Alternatively, if you’re not a programmer, you can contribute by buying me a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jelly_flac">coffee</a> ☕ to help keep this website running.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>I've found a problem! What can I do? 🐛</h3>
					<p>It’s simple! You can explain the error through the GitHub repository’s <a href="#">issues</a> and <a href="#">discussions</a> section. Feel free to explore the code if you’re a programmer—any help is welcome. 🙌 </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>My mixtape doesn't look right! I don't recognize these songs or artists! 🕵️‍♀️</h3>
					<p>This website operates with data provided by the Spotify API, so if you see a song you don’t remember or an artist you’ve never listened to, it’s not my fault! It’s likely due to some error on Spotify’s end (or maybe you heard that quirky song just once and forgot about it!).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Mixify is not working! 💢</h3>
					<p>Often, when there are issues on the website, it’s because you’ve made too many consecutive requests to the Spotify platform. Simply wait a few minutes and try again.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Why did you create this website? 💜</h3>
					<p>The answer is simple: For fun! I was looking for an enjoyable project to practice my programming skills, and after considering several ideas, this turned out to be the one I chose to develop.</p>
