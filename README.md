# **MIXIFY** 🎶

Mixify is a simple web that generates an image, taking the data from your Spotify account, like your most listened-to artist, songs or musical genres. 🎵
This web uses the Spotify API to catch the data we need to create the image, then takes all the information and organize them to create an organized and fancy mixtape with your most listened songs, artist or genres in a time period.

This web application was inspired by websites like [**Receiptify**](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/) or [**Instafest**](https://www.instafest.app/home). I wanted to create something similar but with my own ideas, so this is the result!

You can create your mixtape [**here**](https://mixify-site.vercel.app/).
