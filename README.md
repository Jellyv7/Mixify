# **MIXIFY** ðŸŽ¶

Mixify is a simple web that generates an image, taking the data from your Spotify account, like your most listened-to artist, songs or musical genres. ðŸŽµ
This web uses the Spotify API to catch the data we need to create the image, then takes all the information and organize them to create an organized and fancy mixtape with your most listened songs, artist or genres in a time period.

This web application was inspired by websites like [**Receiptify**](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/) or [**Instafest**](https://www.instafest.app/home). I wanted to create something similar but with my own ideas, so this is the result!

You can create your mixtape [**here**](spotifymixify.netlify.app).

## THIS IS AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT

Don't be afraid to fork the project or send a pull request, I'm open to new functionality or make my own code better. 

## Why Javascript Vanilla?

This project was intended to practice my abilities on pure Javascript, so this was a challenge for me. That's the answer. ðŸ¤
